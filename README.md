Tree-Based Intelligent Intrusion Detection System in Internet of Vehicles



This project is based on the paper entitled "Tree-Based Intelligent Intrusion Detection System in Internet of Vehicles" published in IEEE GlobeCom 2019.

The use of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a promising technology in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) to improve safety and driving efficiency. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology enables communication among vehicles and other infrastructures. However, AVs and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) are vulnerable to different types of cyber-attacks such as denial of service, spoofing, and sniffing attacks.An intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) is proposed based on tree-structure machine learning models. The results from the implementation of this  intrusion detection system on standard data sets indicate that the system has the ability to identify various cyber-attacks in the AV networks. the used dataset is also uploaded in repository.
