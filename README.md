------
The use of autonomous vehiclesis a promising technology in Intelligent Transportation Systems to improve safety and driving efficiency. Vehicle-to-everything  technology enables communication among vehicles and other infrastructures. However, AVs and Internet of Vehicles are vulnerable to different types of cyber-attacks such as denial of service, spoofing, and sniffing attacks.An intelligent intrusion detection system  is proposed based on tree-structure machine learning models. The results from the implementation of this  intrusion detection system on standard data sets indicate that the system has the ability to identify various cyber-attacks in the AV networks. the used dataset is also uploaded in repository.
