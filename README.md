Tree-Based Intelligent Intrusion Detection System in Internet of Vehicles

INTRO
------
An innovative method for enhancing safety and driving effectiveness in Intelligent Transportation Systems is the deployment of autonomous vehicles. Communication between vehicles and other infrastructures is made possible by vehicle-to-everything technology. However, Autonomous vehicles and the Internet of Vehicles are vulnerable to many cyberattacks, including spoofing, sniffer, and denial of service attacks. On the basis of tree-structure machine learning models, an intelligent intrusion detection system is suggested. The results of using this intrusion detection system on common data sets show that the system can recognise different types of cyber attacks in Autonomous vehicles  networks. The data set that was utilised is also stored in the repository(CICIDS2017_sample.csv).
